  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
      <em>The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ</em> is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible.
      It is a record of God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel.
      To learn more, see <a href="https://www.comeuntochrist.org/beliefs/book-of-mormon">ComeUntoChrist.org</a></a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, I've created this new edition of the Book of Mormon as a personal study project.
    It has the same text as the official <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/new-edition">LDS edition</a>, but with modern formatting inspired by the <a href="https://www.thenivbible.com/">NIV Bible</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The text is organized into paragraphs, with verse numbers as superscripts.
    Chapter headings have been replaced by section headings within the text.
    Quote marks have been added to indicate dialog and citation of scripture.
    Poetry, lists, prayers, and other literary elements have special typesetting.
    All footnotes have been removed, and page headings have been simplified.
    Some of the capitalization and punctuation choices have been modernized.
  </p>
  <p>
    The complete PDF is available as a free download.

  <h3>Sample Pages</h3>
  <p>In contrast to other editions that have been organized into paragraphs, this edition uses a traditional two-column format. The page size is 6"x9", which makes the book lightweight and easy to take with you. The main text is set in Palatino 9-point font.</p>

    My hope and intent in typesetting the Book of Mormon is that people will better understand its message and appreciate the depth and complexity of its narrative.
    For many years, the <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm">Book of Mormon</a> has greatly strengthened my testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ and His latter-day work, as have the <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bible">Old and New Testaments</a>, the <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament">Doctrine and Covenants</a>, and the <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp">Pearl of Great Price</a>.
    These volumes of scripture truly contain the words of eternal life.
